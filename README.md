# NeuroStock:Stock Price Prediction System - Personal Finance
## Overview
NeuroStock is an advanced deep learning framework designed to predict stock prices with high accuracy, leveraging Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Hybrid CNN-LSTM models. Developed as a final semester project from June to December 2024, NeuroStock processes real-time financial data from the Yahoo Finance API (yfinance) to forecast stock prices over customizable horizons of 7 to 60 days. Deployed as an interactive Streamlit web application, it enables users to select stock tickers, adjust model parameters, visualize predictions, and compare model performance in real time. Tested on Google (GOOG) stock data spanning 10 years, NeuroStock achieves robust performance, with the Hybrid CNN-LSTM model balancing accuracy (RMSE: 9.218274, RÂ²: 0.913406) and directional metrics (Accuracy: 0.476902, Precision: 0.505593). The project addresses gaps in prior work by offering comprehensive model comparisons, directional trend evaluation, and a user-friendly interface, making it a valuable tool for investors and financial analysts.
